%description
Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core
is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
